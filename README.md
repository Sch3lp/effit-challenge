# effit-challenge web app
Web application for the PHUCQIT Challenge:  
A week filled with challenges to make your Snowcase holiday even more memorable.


## Stack
Backend will be a SpringBoot web application built in Kotlin.

Frontend will be a VueJS app.

SpringBoot web app both serves the REST API, **and** the VueJS app.

## A note on incremental architecture
We'll start off by building a monolith (with an attempt at keeping it modular).
